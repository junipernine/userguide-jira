UserGuide for Jira

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

# This is an h1 tag
## This is an h2 tag
###### This is an h6 tag

*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

*You **can** combine them*

## Unordered Lists

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b

## Ordered Lists

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
   * Item 3a
   * Item 3b

## Images

![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)

Format: ![Alt Text](url)  

## Blockquotes

As Kanye West said:

> We're living the future so
> the present is our past.

## Inline code

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

## Tables

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

AutoLinking URLs

Any URL (like http://www.github.com/) will be automatically converted into a clickable link.

## Strikethrough

Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.
